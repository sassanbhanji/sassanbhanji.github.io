#### Music

- I used to study Viola and Violin at the Royal College of Music Junior Department where I achieved diplomas in both
- I was also co-principal violist of the National Youth Orchestra
- At Cambridge University, I'm a recipient of an Instrumental Award and frequently perform with my string quartet, the Alea Quartet. In my 2nd year I was principal violist of the Cambridge University Orchestra (CUO)

#### Languages

- I love learning foreign languages - so far I've learnt French, Spanish and Italian and hope to learn more in the future!
