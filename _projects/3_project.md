From October to December 2025, I participated in a selective startup accelerator in Cambridge run by Cambridge University Entrepreneurs.

Alongside Maharu Gunasekara and William Goacher, I worked on building an application aimed at improving access to secure and reliable employment in developing countries, starting with Kenya, where my family is from.

In Kenya, much of the manual labour market - such as domestic workers, handymen, and other informal roles - operates through word of mouth. While this system is familiar and trusted, it often leads to insecure, unregulated employment and disadvantages individuals who lack strong social connections. Employers also frequently hire workers with very limited information about their background, skills, or reliability.

Our application aims to make this process safer, fairer, and more transparent for both workers and employers. By leveraging WhatsApp, which has over 97% penetration in Kenya, we chose a platform people already use daily, eliminating the need for new apps or technical literacy. Using AI-driven conversational interfaces, the system can speak and understand multiple languages, making it accessible across regions, literacy levels, and future international markets.

The platform is designed to provide additional guarantees for employers, such as verified profiles and work histories, while helping workers discover opportunities beyond their immediate networks.

The next steps for the project include collecting structured worker CVs, onboarding employers and recruitment agencies, and building intelligent matching between labour supply and demand. Ultimately, the goal is to formalise informal labour markets in a way that increases trust, job security, and economic mobility without disrupting existing communication habits.
